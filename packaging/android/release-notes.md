**Starling 0.2.3: bring your worlds over from Horizon Android.**

Horizon Android and Starling are becoming one app, in [starling-client](https://github.com/starling-client/starling). Starling installs beside Horizon Android and takes nothing from it.

## Install

- **Already have Starling:** tap **Update** inside the game.
- **New here, or coming from Horizon Android:** download **`starling-0.2.3-arm64-v8a.apk`** below and open it.

## What's new

- **Coming from Horizon Android?** Starling offers to bring its worlds and resource packs over: in the setup on the first start, or over the title screen if Starling is already set up. Close Horizon Android, tap **Bring them over**, then **Use this folder** and **Allow**. They are copied: Horizon Android keeps its own.
- **A new note for what you import:** a banner drops in across the top of the screen, with a sound, and says what each file you open with Starling added, or what went wrong.
- **Native mods that record sound ask for the microphone:** when the game starts with one, Starling says which mod wants it and Android asks you. **Not now** stops asking for that build.
- **The first start goes on to the title screen** once the game is prepared. It used to stay on **Starting Starling** until Starling was opened again.
- Starling also looks for updates in the new [starling-client/starling](https://github.com/starling-client/starling) repository.
- Compiled native mods: compile them again after this update.

## New in 0.2.2

- **Many more `.hnmod` native mods from [playhorizon.dev/mods](https://playhorizon.dev/mods) now compile**, like AppleSkin, Mod Menu, SmartF3, Freecam, Waymap and Distant Horizons. Open the mod's `.hnmod` with Starling, go to **Mods** and tap **Compile**.
- **Fixed the crash on opening** on GPUs limited to 4096x4096 textures, like the PowerVR GE8320. The largest textures load at half size when they don't fit.
- **More builds a day:** 16 instead of 8, and a build that fails gives its place back.

## New in 0.2.1

- **Shader packs run on Mali phones again.** On phones with a Mali GPU every pack stayed vanilla since 0.2.0.
- A pack that can't run on your phone now says so in the chat and turns off.

## New in 0.2.0, the biggest update yet

### Mods: `.hmod` and `.hnmod`

Open either kind of file with Starling, from your file manager or your downloads, and it shows up in **Mods**.

- **`.hnmod`, native mods:** tap **Compile**. Starling tells you the risks, builds the game with your mods while you fish or mine, and restarts with them. It takes a few minutes and needs a connection.
- **`.hmod`, content mods:** data-only mods, with nothing to compile. A dropped download of a mod's assets goes on from where it stopped.

The old Starling mods (Far View, FPS Overlay, Keystrokes, Minimap, Recipes, Zoom) and the wasm mod format are gone: mods now use Horizon's formats.

### Controls

- **Bedrock Inventory:** the creative inventory shows the items and your inventory side by side, with six rows of items and a 2x2 crafting grid, and a tap takes a full stack. It is on by default; turn it off in **Options > Controls** for the Java layout.
- **Custom buttons:** tap **Add** in **Touch Controls**, or go to **Options > Controls > Custom Buttons**. Each one holds or toggles a key, a native mod's key included, or sends a command or a message. Give them an icon or your own image, drawn on Bedrock's plate or imported as a PNG, and another image for while they are pressed. Select one in **Touch Controls** to move it or delete it.
- **On-screen keyboard:** a tap on a text field brings it up and a tap beside it puts it away, on every screen, number boxes included. It no longer opens by itself on the world list or in the creative inventory.
- A double tap on a stack moves it straight to the other side, as Shift-click does.
- The held F3 button also has the other F keys, and the F3 text is bigger: it follows the GUI scale.
- The three-finger Stats tap is off unless you turn it on (**3-tap** in the touch editor).

### Shader packs

- **Auto profile:** fits a pack to the phone by what its profiles ask of it, and draws terrain's depth first.
- **Shader Options** for a finger, and **Resolution** and **FPS Limit** on the Shader Packs page.
- Water and terrain came back in Photon, Sildur's and Bliss, and superDuperVanilla lost its overlay.
- Packs' own textures load, a block's cracks show, faces are no longer shaded twice, and the sky reaches the horizon.
- A pack that loses the graphics device is turned off instead of closing the game.

### Newest Horizon

Starling now sits on the newest Horizon, about 4,800 commits ahead of the previous base:

- Many more vanilla behaviours for mobs: piglins, dolphins, wolves, foxes, zombies with spears, mobs boarding minecarts and picking up gear.
- Remote players' hands and shoulder parrots, the jeb_ sheep's colours, and the portal loading screen on a server's dimension change.
- Optimize World inside Edit World, and operator commands (`/op`, `/deop`, `/ban`, `/pardon`, `/whitelist`) on a dedicated server.
- Your own skin shows with offline accounts, and on LAN the host's skin shows.

## Report a bug

Open an [issue](https://github.com/JuanLuci/starling/issues/new/choose): the form asks for your phone, your Android version and `Starling/logs/latest.log` (with `previous.log` beside it once Starling has been opened again).
